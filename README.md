#  Weather Analysis Project

This project involves a comprehensive time series analysis of weather data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It focuses on exploring and visualizing key weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions over time.

## 📘 Project Summary

## import the libraries

# Q.1) Find all the unique "Wind Speed" values in the data

# Q.2) find the no.of times when weather is exactly clear

# Q.3) Find no.of times when the wind speed was exactly '4km/h'

# Q.4) find out all null values in the data

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

- Data Loading and Initial Inspection
- Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (Extracting date/time components)
- Data Filtering (e.g., clear skies, high humidity)
- Grouping and Aggregation (e.g., average values by weather condition)
- Visualizations:
  - Line plots for temperature/humidity trends
  - Bar charts and count plots for weather frequency
  - Box plots for comparison of weather distributions
- Insights from Weather Patterns
